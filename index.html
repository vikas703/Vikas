  <h1>About:</h1>
  <p><br></p>
  <p > The moment I saw my computer I was so excited to use it.
   When I used it for the first time I was completely astounded by its speed and the way it works.
   This is the instance that provoked me to learn more about computers. 
   During my higher secondary education, I started to learn about computers.
   As I came to know more and more about computers the next thing that captivated me was software. 
   Softwares are like the results of computers through which we can use a computer proficiently. 
   When I came to know more about software and the way they work I became familiar with programming. 
   After learning to program, I built a couple of websites like the one I have to describe myself and some projects using <strong class="hhh"> Python, HTML, and CSS and Java.</strong>
   Gradually Softwares and websites made me realize how many people use these services and with billions of devices now online,
   new threats pop-up every second.

<p class="text">
  Interestingly 90% of the data in the world was generated in the past three years(2018 and 2019 and 2020) which also means that there is a huge need for software development.
  This blew my mind and I know that there are many services where development is a must and this is where my role comes into play. I have developed a passion to become a <strong>Software Developer</strong>
